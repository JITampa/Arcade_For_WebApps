#This script is used in a feature layer for visualization under the symbology attribute expression. It takes 3 fields that have domains that being imported with glitches such as spaces or underscores from Survey123 or by editing errors and corrects them to #keep the domain values true so the sumbology does not get classified as other, the 3 fields are named: lane closure type, road closure type, and other type. If the script finds a unique key word it classifies all with that keyword under the domain name, then #symbology is set on test records with a permit number 999 that can be filtered out, this holds the symbology settings like color and line weight even when a closure type is not active in the map.
